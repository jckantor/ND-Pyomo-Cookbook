Cloud services work effectively with the Pyomo notebooks in this collection including Google Colaboratory, Microsoft Azure, and [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/). These online services provide an excellent means for viewing and executing notebooks, even those with complicated Pyomo models.\n",

    "\n",
    "Developing scientific and engineering applications in [Python](https://www.python.org/) requires an interpreter for a particular version of the Python language, a collection of previously developed software libraries, and additional development tools including editors and package managers. Together these elements comprise a Python distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many [Python distributions](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDistributions) available from commercial and free sources.  The Anaconda distribution available from [Anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/) is among the most complete and best known distributions currently available, and is available as a [free download](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) or in commercially supported enterprise version. Anaconda includes\n",

    "\n",
    "1. If you have previously installed Anaconda and wish to start over, then a first step is to [uninstall the earlier version](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall). While it is possible to maintain multiple versions of Anaconda, there are problems that can arise when installing new packages. Uninstalling prior installations of Anaconda installations is the easiest way to avoid those problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Download](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) a version of Anaconda appropriate for your laptop. Unless you have a specific reason to use an earlier version of the Python language, download the 64-bit graphical installer for the latest version of Python (currently Python 3.6).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Locate and launch the graphical installer from your download directory. Either follow the prompts or consult these more [detailed instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). Normally you will want to use the default choices to install Anaconda into your home folder (a.k.a. directory) for your use only. Generally there is no need to install the optional Microsoft VSCode. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. [Verify](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/verify-install) that your installation is working. For example, you should be able to locate and lauch a new application Anaconda Navigator.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Install any available package updates. Open a command line (either the Terminal application on a Mac located look in the Applications/Utilities folder, or the Command Prompt on Windows), and execute the following two commands on separate lines.\n",

    "\n",
    "    conda update conda\n",

    "The Ipopt package uses third-party packages for solving linear subproblems which are generally the most time-consuming steps in the solution algorithm. By default, ipopt is distributed with the [mumps](http://mumps.enseeiht.fr/) solvers. If you expect make extensive use of Ipopt for nonlinear problems, or to be solving larger models with 10's of thousands of variables, then you may wish to recompile Ipopt to use high-performance linear solvers available under license from other sources.\n",

Gurobi offers free licenses with one-year terms for academic use, and trial licenses for commercial use.
